# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
This project was created as an assignment for the PennLPS Fullstack Bootcamp.

## Objective
I was asked to create a functioning work calendar that repsonds to the current time and allow the user to save tasks with local storage.
## Approach
I began this week with pseduocoding. This project was a refactor project so my sketching was very minimal this week. I used the mockup and Bootstrap elements to create a similar looking page.

After matching the design details, I proceeded to use Moment.js to display the date along with working hours for the planner. There were several ways to approach this, but I decided to declare the anchor time as 9am and created corresponding rows by adding an hour to each row for a total of 8 hours.

Using the get and set mehtod, I was able to save the user's task in Local Storage. Using the corresponding ID from the saved task, when reloaded, the page will display previous entries.

## Final Statement/ Conclusion
As the weeks progress, our tasks become all the more challenging. Although I hit some creative stumbling blocks this week, I feel proud of what I was able to achieve. I look forward to expanding my skills and adding my newly found tools, jQuery and Bootstrap to my developer toolbelt.
